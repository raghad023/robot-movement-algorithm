Input:

Six servo motors (L_Hip, L_Knee, L_Ankle, R_Hip, R_Knee, R_Ankle)
Predefined angles for each servo motor
Timing delays between movements

Output:

Sequential movements of the robot's legs to simulate walking

Initialize Servo Motors:

Assign each servo motor to a variable.
Define the initial angles for each servo motor.

Start Walking Cycle:

While true (continuous loop):

Phase 1: Lift Left Leg

Move L_Knee to bending angle 
Move L_Ankle to lifting angle 
Wait for a short delay.
Phase 2: Move Left Leg Forward

Move L_Hip to forward angle 
Wait for a short delay.
Phase 3: Lower Left Leg

Move L_Knee to straight angle 
Move L_Ankle to neutral angle 
Wait for a short delay.
Phase 4: Push Off with Right Leg

Move R_Knee to bending angle 
Move R_Ankle to lifting angle 
Wait for a short delay.
Phase 5: Move Right Leg Forward

Move R_Hip to forward angle (e.g., 45Â°).
Wait for a short delay.

Phase 6: Lower Right Leg

Move R_Knee to straight angle 
Move R_Ankle to neutral angle 
Wait for a short delay.
Optional Phase: Reset Hip Angles

Move L_Hip and R_Hip to neutral angles 
Wait for a short delay.
Repeat the Walking Cycle:

Keep repeating Phases 1 through 6 to continue walking.
